## Compile and Execute C Program
Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. 
Following are the simple steps −

- Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
- Save the file as hello.c
- Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.
- Type gcc hello.c and press enter to compile your code.

If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.

- Now, type a.out to execute your program.
You will see the output "Hello World" printed on the screen.


## Keywords

The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.


|  Keyword  |  Keyword  |  Keyword  |  Keyword  |  Keyword |
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|    auto   |    else   |    long   |  switch   |	   |
|   break   |    enum   | register  |  typedef  |	   |
|    case   |   extern  |  return   |   union   |	   |
|    char   |   float   |   short   | unsigned  |	   |


## Data Types in C
C - Data Types

Data types in c refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.

The types in C can be classified as follows −

Sr.No.	Types & Description	
- 1. Basic Types

They are arithmetic types and are further classified into: (a) integer types and (b) floating-point types.

	
- 2. Enumerated types

They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only assign certain discrete integer values throughout the program.
	
- 3. The type void

The type specifier void indicates that no value is available.
	
- 4. Derived types

They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types.

The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where as other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.
