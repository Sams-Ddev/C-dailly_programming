# Functions in C Programming

Welcome to the GitHub Daily Challenge! In this challenge, we will explore the concept of functions in the C programming language. Functions play a crucial role in organizing and structuring our code, enabling code reuse and modularity. This README will provide an overview of functions and their usage in C programming.

## 1. What are Functions?
In C programming, a function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. It is a self-contained unit of code that can be called from other parts of the program. Functions help in breaking down complex tasks into smaller manageable parts, improving code readability and maintainability.

## 2. Function Declaration and Definition
To use a function in C, we need to declare and define it. Function declaration tells the compiler about the existence of the function, its name, return type, and parameter list. Function definition provides the actual implementation of the function.

## 3. Function Parameters and Return Values
Functions can accept input parameters, which are values passed to the function for processing. Parameters allow functions to work with different data values without duplicating the code. Functions can also have a return type, which specifies the type of value the function will return back to the caller.

## 4. Function Prototypes
A function prototype is a forward declaration of a function before its actual definition. It specifies the function name, return type, and parameter list. Function prototypes are typically placed at the beginning of the source file or in header files to inform the compiler about the function's existence.

## 5. Function Call
To use a function, we need to call it. A function call transfers the control from the caller to the function. It executes the function code, and if the function has a return value, it can be assigned to a variable or used in expressions.

## 6. Example: Creating and Using Functions
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
    int sum = add(num1, num2);  // Function call
    printf("The sum is %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## 7. Conclusion
Functions are an essential concept in C programming, enabling code modularity, reusability, and organization. They allow us to break down complex tasks into smaller manageable parts, making our code easier to understand and maintain. Understanding how to declare, define, and use functions will greatly enhance your programming skills.

Now that you have a good understanding of functions in C programming, feel free to dive into the GitHub Daily Challenge and apply your knowledge by solving exciting programming problems!
