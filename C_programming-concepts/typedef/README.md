#Typedef Concepts

In all these examples, typedef is used to create 
new type names (myInt, myFloat, Point, BinaryOperation, IntArray, and Color) 
that can be used to declare variables, functions, and structures more conveniently. 
It helps improve code readability and maintainability by providing descriptive aliases 
for existing data types and complex declarations..
