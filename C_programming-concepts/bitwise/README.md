# C Programming Concepts on Bitwise Operation

##Left shift opreand: 
- Left shifting is equivalent to the multiplication by 2 exponent right operand
###Examples: 
	var = 3;
	var << 1 = (3x2 exponet 1)

- Right shifting is equivalent to the multiplication by 2 exponent right operand
###Examples:
	var = 3;
        var << 1 = (3/2 exponet 1)
