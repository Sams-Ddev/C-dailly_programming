# C Programming Practice

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects and exercises to help you practice and improve your C programming skills. Each project focuses on different aspects of the C language, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## Project Examples

1. **Hello, World!** - A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **Input and Output** - Demonstrates how to take user input and display output using `scanf` and `printf`.
3. **Conditional Statements** - Introduces conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `switch` for decision-making.
4. **Loops** - Illustrates the use of loops such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` for repetition.
5. **Arrays** - Explores the creation and manipulation of arrays, including accessing elements and performing operations.
6. **Functions** - Demonstrates the definition and usage of functions to modularize code.
7. **Structures** - Introduces structures to create custom data types with multiple properties.
8. **File Handling** - Covers reading from and writing to files using file handling functions.
9. **Memory Allocation** - Explores dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`.
10. **Projects** - Offers small project ideas to challenge yourself and apply multiple concepts.

Feel free to explore the projects, modify the code, and use them as a starting point for your own projects. Each project is accompanied by a detailed explanation and example code to help you understand and learn.

## Applications of C Programming
C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -

- Operating Systems
- Language Compilers
- Assemblers
- Text Editors
- Print Spoolers
- Network Drivers
- Modern Programs
- Databases
- Language Interpreters
- Utilities
